Coring Events:
1. Autonomy Levels. A no-brainer. 
	Choice 1: No Autonomy - reasoning being that they're Germans
	Choice 2: Autonomy only for Slovenia - Slovenia becomes a puppet. Afterwards, Austrians get enraged and start the Rebellion, while Slovenia stays as a puppet. 
	Choice 3: Autonomy for Austria - Austria becomes an integrated puppet under an Austrian nazi. However, a Coup happens and Ludwig Hermentin starts the rebellion (without Slovenia)
2. Status of Austrians
	Choice 1: Initially give them benefits which increases consumer goods factories and takes a bit of PP. Opposition forms because of, as they say, an attempt at brainwashing
	Choice 2: Treat them as Germans, takes away a bit of PP since documentation and such
	Choice 3: They can't be compared to Germans in Germany, triggers a rebellion afterwards.
3. Status of Non-German Minorities
	Choice 1: They're Germanized enough
	Choice 2: Treat them like any other (hint: germany doesn't treat its minorities well). Eventually leads to a rebellion
	Choice 3: Immediately exile them. Leads to a rebellion, but a weaker Slovenia and Austria with less manpower
4. Status of the Opposition
	Choice 1: Restrict them, but allow them to operate. Afterwards, they get successful and form a resistance group.
	Choice 2: Ban Austrian opposition parties. They assemble "illegaly" and start the rebellion. Costs PP
	Choice 3: Organize a huge crackdown. Costs quite a lot of PP.

Civil War:
-Slovenia and Austria have the "Rebellion" modifiers
-Istria can defect to Slovenia if Italy and Germany are allies
-Italy can seize Istria if not in the same Alliance
-If South Germany ( IDs: Or = { 50,52,53 }, 54 ) gets occupied, then Austria achieves independence
-If Germany wins, Austria is cored because most resistance was wiped
