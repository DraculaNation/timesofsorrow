 ### Other
  PAC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As the Great Depression has left America in a state of ruin, the West Coast was one of the regions that suffered the most. In order not to suffer huge unrest and rebellions, the USA has granted independence to the states of Oregon and California, grouping them together to create the Pacific Federation, and put a staunch isolationism, Hiram Johnson, as the head of the provisional government. Will the Pacific Federation rise above all, or fall under the USA once again?"
