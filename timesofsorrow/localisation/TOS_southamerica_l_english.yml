  southamerica.2.t:0 "Yearly Tourism Report"
  southamerica.2.d:0 "Our ministers have calculated how tourism this year has went. It seems we have great news - this year has been stronger in terms of tourism, than most others. It is sure nice to be away from all the chaos outside of South America!"
  southamerica.2.a:0 "We love this blissful isolation!"
  southamerica.3.t:0 "Yearly Tourism Report"
  southamerica.3.d:0 "Our ministers have calculated how tourism this year has went. It seems we have done as good as we usually do - not better, not worse. Still, our tourism industry is huge compared to other countries."
  southamerica.3.a:0 "It could have been worse."
  southamerica.4.t:0 "Yearly Tourism Report"
  southamerica.4.d:0 "Our people have calculated how tourism this year has went. It seems we are doing awfully - not many tourists have visited us in this year. Our slightly competitive neighbours are glad that they're above us. At least we're not being ravaged by war and chaos."
  southamerica.4.a:0 "Gosh darnit."
