conservatism:0 "Republicanist"
conservatism_desc:0 "Although having democratic principles, republicansists, also known as dictatorial republics, carefully balance power between various factions in the state, usually with the people having little to no influence. This enables the government to perform actions that would otherwise be met with significant political resistance, such as declaring war on other countries. The term 'republicanist' can also be extended to encompass various, corruption-filled, flawed democracies in the world, where the ruling party always wins."

Authoritarianism is often represented in absolutist monarchies and military juntas, as well as some governments under martial law."
socialism:0 "Absolutist"
socialism_desc:0 "Absolutism is one of the more common Authoritarian ideologies. One of the oldest ideologies in the world, Absolutism encompasses every country ruled by a king who has a great amount of power. Be it a feudal or a pure absolutist society, Absolutist countries have gotten used to being under a royal dictatoship, most of the times.

It has already been one of the most common ideologies in the world, and only recently are the times changing."

anti_revisionism:0 "Socialist"
anti_revisionism_desc:0 "Socialist is a term encompassing all of the ideologies based on the philosophy of the normal population owning the means of the production, not any other organization like the state or a company. However, some socialist ideologies make compromises based on these philosophies - sometimes, the state owns the means of productions, giving workers various jobs. This is a relatively new category of ideologies, with one of its biggest proponents, Karl Marx, dying about 50 years ago."
anarchist_communist:0 "Anarchist"
anarchist_communist_desc:0 "There are many anarchist factions in the world, however most of them are encompassed in Anarcho-Socialism. Whether it be Anarcho-Mutualism, Anarcho-Syndicalism or Anarcho-Communism, anarchist countries sometimes have a head of state, but their power is very decentralized, and the government's grip over its citizens is next to nothing. Some extreme versions of socialist anarchism advocate for the abolition of wages, and with the people, as a community, sharing property and everything else."

nazism:0 "National Socialist"
nazism_desc:0 "National Socialism is an ideology which combines the nationalist, irredentist qualities of fascism, and some economic policies of socialism. 'Revolutionized' by the National Socialist German Workers' Party, nazism is a big proponent of social darwinism and racial theories, mostly twisted in order to appeal to their country. National Socialism rejects the Marxist principles of a class struggle, and instead switches it with struggle of various nationalities, both in the internal and external scene."
fascism_ideology:0 "Fascist"
fascism_ideology_desc:0 "Fascism is a very authoritarian ideology, which focuses on militarism and centralizing power to one entity in the political structure. However, fascism is almost always combined with irredentist elements, and fueled by its militarism, often advocates for mobilization. It most often advocates a third position, compared to capitalism and communism. These countries mostly denounce democracies, with somewhat of a good reason, instead advocating for a one-party, totalitarian state."
falangism:0 "Nationalism"
falangism_desc:0 "Nationalism can encompass many forms of governments, most of which are authoritarian. Unlike governments categoried as 'Authoritarian', nationalist governments promise to work in favor of their citizens. Whether it be fueling irredentism, or getting out of a crisis in an unethical way, nationalist ideologies are shunned by both Socialist, Authoritarian and Disjointed governments, which somewhat rightfully label them as ideologies of chaos and unrest."
rexism:0 "Nationalism"

despotism:0 "Disjointed"
despotism_desc:0 "Disjointed is a term describing most governments where they're either inefficient to administrate, or the state holds little power while people almost always disagree. These governments mostly spend their time in isolation and focusing on internal politics, including dealing with their opposition, mostly in an ethical way. These disjointed countries can rarely break the rules they've written, but if they did, it would cause unrest and distrust among people living in them."
oligarchic:0 "Autonomist"
oligarchic_desc:0 "Autonomism can encompass any ideology with several tiers in a pyamid-like structure. However, most of these countries' central governments are very weak, and have little control over more local administrations. This ideology is mostly made as a compromise with regions containing separatist elements. Whether this form of government would either fuel the separatism or actually tame them, is mostly unknown. What is known, is that the central government can rarely have power, lest the local administrations would rebel."
moderatism:0 "Democratic"
moderatism_desc:0 "Various countries which are presumably focused on freedom, have democracies as their ideologies. Democracy can encompass any type of government, where the citizens can vote on various changes, often overlapping with republicanism. However, some democracies are known for their fractured internal factions, and being a nest of corruption. As people's faith in democracy has fallen since the Great War, and most of the population being against wars, it is very difficult for democratic nations to get involved in almost any sort of conflict."
